// assumes the RawFields_Tm00 database has already been built with its tables and columns
// as well as the ClusteredFields_Tm00 database with its tables

Build Event Lists
Feed EventLists through AnomalyCollection
    Example execution:   AnomalyCollection EventLists/Snow.dat [--database=^DatabaseName^] [--offset=HourOffset] [--config=^ConfigFilename^]
    This will put files into NewData/^Database^
    HourOffset, if given, will be added to the time of the event in the file.  So if I want the anomalies 6 hours before the event,
    I would put -6 for the HourOffset.

Run the Strong Point Analysis clustering program
   Example executions:   ClusterWork --silent         #  <--- This will cluster the fields using default values and save the clusters to files
                         ClusterWork --test           #  <--- This will cluster the fields using default values, show the fields' clusters
                                                      #             and accompanying info, but NOT save them to files.
                         ClusterWork --fulltest       #  <--- Same mode as '--test' except that all the clusters for each field is shown
                                                      #             As with '--test', NO clusters are saved.
			 ClusterWork --help           #  <--- Shows man-like information about the program and the available arguements
                                                      #             Also shows the default values and other settings.
			 ClusterWork --syntax         #  <--- Shows the syntax for executing the program.

   It will extract lon/lat/anom/date information directly from the mySQL database.  All clustered information is then inserted back into the
      clustered database.
   It also produces the *.FieldMeasure files in the AnalysisInfo/^ClustDatabase^ directory, but only containing the alpha and the phi measures.
   *.FieldMeasure files eventually holds Alpha, Phi, GammaMax, and ChiMax.
   I want the mysql to contain these values, eventually.

// This next step is only for backwards compatability purposes, only.
Run LonLatAnomExtract

Run MakeScript_DrawMaps at any time after this point.
	The DrawMaps program is used to create the fingerprint maps.  For more info about available options, you can run 
	   the program with the '--help' option to see a man-like page or '--syntax' for syntaxical info.
	This program makes the scripts to make the map plots.  The map plots are made using GrADS, so it uses the files generated by
	   LonLatAnomExtract.  Eventually, I want to have a program that can interact directly with mySQL.


MakeFile_HtmlView can NOT be executed at this point since other files are still needed to be created.


// VERY IMPORTANT!!! This program needs to be changed before it can be used with the NARR database.
// It assumes a Rectilinear coordinate system.
Run FindGammaMaxChi     This program analyzes the clusters to determine the maximum possible Gamma
			    value (within a small, but unknown,  margin of error) and the maximum possible Chi value (there is no error
			    for the Histogram method of calculating Chi since the program captures every possible value).
			The program creates *.FieldMeasure files in the directory AnalysisInfo/^ClustDatabase^
                            At this point, *.FieldMeasure files contains all the measures it should have, namely Alpha, Phi, GammaMax
                            and ChiMax.  I hope to eventually have this information directly placed into the mySQL database.
			Run with the '--help' or '--syntax' option to see available options and parameters.


//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 	Note, this program also uses the flat files from LonLatAnomExtract to process the data.  Will change to mySQL.

Run DrawStdAnomHist	This program uses matlab to produce histograms of the standard anomaly values.  The images are placed in
					the directory AnalysisInfo/^Database^ and AnalysisInfo/^ClustDatabase^, respectively.
				Run with the '--help' option to see available options and parameters.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run MakeFile_HtmlView		This program will create the html page and accompanying files showing the complete analysis of the CAFE system
					(not including the hindcast).

At this point, all of the training and measuring of the fields has been completed.
The system is now ready to calculate EventScores.  Use the Hindcast program for that...



Forecast data is placed in the Forecast directory.  Currently, the only program to do that is
TotalRecall.  It takes a single date/time request in the grad scripting format (i.e. - 18Z21MAY1985).
It then retrives, from the global NCEP reanalysis dataset, the peaks and valleys of every needed variable
at that point in time.  The info is placed in the Forecast directory.

With data in the forecast directory, the program "CalcCorrelation" will use that info with 
data in the AnalysisInfo directory to calculate the EventScores for the time in question.
