CAFE-1.0

These instructions were designed with the PSU Meteorology network in mind.
The typical profile on this network uses csh for the terminal interface.

LICENSE

Tenatively,
ASSUME THAT EVERYTHING IN THIS PACKAGE IS OWNED AND LICENSED BY THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY

I hope to eventually release this under some form of the GPL.


Installation
============

First, add the following two lines to your ~/.cshrc.cat file:

  setenv CAFE_PATH ====GIVE PATH TO CAFE INSTALLATION HERE====
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $CAFE_PATH/lib

Make sure that there is a new line after the last setenv command.
Then, at the command line, type the following:

  % source ~/.cshrc.cat

Then, cd over to the CAFE directory.
To build all of the programs, type:

  % make all

Assuming everything worked as expected, you can then begin training.


Notes
=====

If compilation does not finish successfully, then you may need to
modify the 'include.mk' file.  If you have all of the dependencies
installed (BUtils, mysqlpp, etc...), then you may have the locations
wrong.  Typically, if it isn't in /usr/include, then it might be in
/usr/local/include, or /usr/global/include.  The same goes for /usr/lib.


Running CAFE
============

CAFE commands should be executed from the CAFE directory.  The executables
are kept in the bin/ folder.  For example, to execute 'TableMaker'
program, type the following in the command line:

  % bin/TableMaker

Note that the current working directory should be the CAFE_PATH.

This odd-ball convention is due to a design flaw in some of the programs,
and it will be worked out in later releases of CAFE.
